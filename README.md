# HR-Analytics-and-Predicting-Employee-Attrition
The aim of the project was to get insight from the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition &amp; Performance dataset using Machine Learning. Made use of Python libraries like Seaborn to visualize correlations between different features since employee attrition can be heavily linked to other factors like, Overtime work, managers, years at company, etc. The dataset was for the most past clean, the only area of improvement was feature engineering and encoding of categorical variables. With the finalized dataset, we proceeded to make use of Decision Tree XGBoost Algorithms to help predict employee churn with an accuracy of 88%.
